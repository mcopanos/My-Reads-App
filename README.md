# MyReads Project
This is a single page app made in react to keep track of the books the you have read, want to read, or are currently reading. You can move books from shelf to shelf, and search for more books. To have your copy just clone or download the repository to your local machine.

## Important
After coping to your local machine just use:

npm install 

and 

npm start

Now a server should be running the app in localhost
